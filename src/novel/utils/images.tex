% This whole page is an if-statement as a workaround to get Xenops to play
% nice with the main editor. By default it wants to compile all the images
% but it makes them too big and I can't figure out how to change the sizes,
% or disable them. So what I've done is placed all images in here and use a
% different compiler than Xenops for them. Ultimately what this means is that
% Images won't generate in the editor, only equations - as desired in my case.
